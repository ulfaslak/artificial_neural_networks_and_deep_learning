    "This document is what we call a *Jupyter notebook*. We will be using these extensively throughout the course so **READ THIS CLOSELY**. If you understand how notebooks work, you will save yourself lots of time and frustration throughout this course!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic things you need to know about Jupyter notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A notebook is nothing but a list of cells. A cell can either be a **code cell** or a **Markdown cell**. Code cells are for writing executable code, and Markdown cells (like this one) are for explaining things in text and making your notebook more readable. A typical workflow that you will soon get use to, is something like: solving a problem with some code in a *code cell* and explaining your reasoning or the results you obtained in a *Markdown cell*. You can toggle cell type when you are in *command mode* by pressing <kbd>y</kbd> for code and <kbd>m</kbd> for Markdown. **Try to do that**. Change this *Markdown* cell to a *code* cell, and change it back again. What happens if you execute (<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd>) when this cell is a code cell, compared to when it is a Markdown cell?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The notebook has two *modes*: **edit mode** and **command mode**. You enter command mode by pressing <kbd>esc</kbd> or clicking outside a cell, and edit mode by clicking a cell and pressing <kbd>enter</kbd> or double clicking a cell. When you're in edit mode, the left border of the current cell turns green (not with `jupyter lab`, though, there the bar is always blue) and whatever you type into your keyboard goes into that cell, whether it is a code or Markdown cell. [Here](http://maxmelnick.com/2016/04/19/python-beginner-tips-and-tricks.html)'s a nice rundown of the different commands you can use. **Beware of <kbd>x</kbd> and <kbd>dd</kbd>**. Read the full list of hotkeys by pressing <kbd>h</kbd> in command mode to figure out why.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Heads up:* Because we'll be using Jupyter notebooks so much in this course, I strongly recommend investing 5 more minutes playing around with cell types, modes and hotkeys. It will save you heaps of time down the road. Above all, make sure you have read and understood these ^ two points!\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a code cell by pressing <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>enter</kbd>, the code gets evaluated by the Python interpreter installed on your computer. The interpreter always returns some output, so unless you store it in a variable, it gets printed below the cell. In general, you will use code cells for doing analysis and working with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Markdown* is a simple markup language for formatting text (like *HTML* or $\\LaTeX$). You will typically use it for writing explanations about how you solve the exercises and the results you get, and styling your notebook with sections and subsections. It can do **bold**, *italics* and $\\LaTeX$ formatting (for equations), and much much more. You can read about the Markdown language [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is your first exercise. The exercise are numbered by the convention `[session]`.`[section]`.`[problem]`.`[subproblem]`. For example, exercise 4.2.3.1 is in week 4, section 2, problem 3, and subproblem 1."
