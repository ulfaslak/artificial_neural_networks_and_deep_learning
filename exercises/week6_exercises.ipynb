    "\n",
    "Deep neural networks are **extremely expensive** to train. Training a good classifier on a complex task, like telling objects in images apart, or determining whether a move in a board game is good, can take weeks on multiple GPUs, cost millions of dollars in cloud computing fees and release massive amounts of CO$_2$ into the atmosphere ([some more than 5 cars over their entire lifetimes!](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02243.pdf)). Because of this, we want to be able to **reuse** weights in models we have trained. This is called transfer learning. The fundamental idea is that things learned in one context can be *transferred* to another context.\n",
